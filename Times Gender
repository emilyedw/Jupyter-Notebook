One quick way to answer that questions\nis to compare the words in sentences that discuss women with the words in sentences that\ndiscuss men. Here's an example of how to do this sort of work using Python. \n\nThe data comes from last week's (February 27 2013-March 6, 2013) New York Times. I downloaded\nall the articles available through LexisNexis except for the corrections and paid\nobituaries. Using a modfied version of a old Python \n[script](http://nealcaren.web.unc.edu/cleaning-up-lexisnexis-files/), I removed all the\nmetadata and put the text\nof each article in its own file and placed all of them in a folder called articles. \nIt is not the most efficient way to go about it, but sometimes the text data comes that way\nso I thought I would be useful to set it up that way for didactic purposes.
